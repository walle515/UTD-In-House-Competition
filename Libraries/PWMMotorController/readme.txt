UT Dallas Robotics PWM Motor Controller Library v1
Written by Joey Hines (joey.ahines@gmail.com)

This library allows for easy interfacing to PWM Motor Controllers. 
The PWM_MotorController class handles all pin setup and pin configuration
while running the motors so the user only has to pass a percent value to
set speed and direction.

To Install:
1. Download the PWM_MotorController folder
2. Copy folder to the Arduino library folder (Usually located under C:\Program Files\Arduino\Library)
3. Include it in the Arduino Sketch you need it for (#include <PWM_MotorController.h>)
4. Compile and Upload Code to Arduino
